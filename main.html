<h2>WHAT is Hibernate?</h2>
<p>Hibernation is a means of powering down your computer while retaining its state.  This means that if you hibernate, your open programs and files will return when you boot back up.  Hibernation differs from "Sleep" mode in that you are able to remove your power source and still retain your computer's state.</p>

<h2>WHY add or use Hibernate?</h2>
<p>RESTART / REBOOT --  If you restart or start Windows without the previous session, none of your apps or the files that were open, will be present.  Further, it can take a long time for the PC th be brought back to a fully booted PC ready for use.  Worse, the user must reopen any closed apps, documents open in those apps, formerly opened web pages, all of which consumes user’s labor.  Worse yet, the user may not remember what they had open, or, in the case of webpages, the state of those pages, like logged in state, etc., is also lost.</p>
<p>SLEEP -- Windows provides this by default, replacing the XP named state of “Standby”.  This is extremely fast in shutting down Windows, preserving your open windows, and quickly bringing them back as soon as you either open the laptop, or hit the power button.  (Only hit the power button once to resume from sleep, and hit it only briefly, or it will reboot instead of resume).  The price for this speed is that, unlike hibernate, your PC or laptop is still consuming power, or your state will be lost.  For instance, if you close most laptops, putting your session to sleep, and don’t wake it up within a fairly short time, you will still be starting your PC from a reboot state, losing what you had.  Worse, if you lose power, your PC will be rebooting from a state where nothing was properly shut down in an orderly manner.  For some users, this can mean your PC does not restart properly</p>
<p>HIBERNATE -- Windows transfers ALL the memory that would normally be lost when power is removed, and transfers it to the hard drive.  Once you start the hibernate process, usually within a minute, the complete “state of the PC” is transferred to your hard drive, and then Windows turns the power completely off on your PC.  This way, when you hit resume, your PC brings you back to where you left off within a minute, and your battery is fully charged, instead of at least partially discharged from trying to maintain the “sleep state”.</p>   
<p>This constant discharge and recharging your battery shortens the life of your battery</p>
<p>On some systems, your PC might have sleep configured so that after a certain amount of time, it will hibernate while in sleep state.  In this case, your PC still will take about a minute to resume, and your battery will still be partially discharged.</p>

<h2>CASES where Hibernate is Essential</h2>
<p>If you are travelling, and decide to “sleep your PC” and not hibernate, you will resume your PC, only to find that you won’t have as much battery left to use on that trip.</p>
<p>If your battery is shot, and you try to move your PC, you will often have to reboot anyway, and when you restart, your system will be restarting from a less than safe state, causing potential problems for your PC, your apps, your data, and you will lose a lot of time because of this.</p>
<p>If your battery is weak, and you carry your PC while power is removed, and you have an intensive program like Windows Update running, your battery will be quickly depleted while updates are running.</p>  
<p>If the battery reaches the “sleep mode”, it will put it to sleep in an unstable state, and often, before you reconnect power, or hibernate, it reboots.  While replacing part of Windows, and your PC is suddenly restarted, you can literally “brick” your system into an unbootable state.</p>

<h2>WHY was Hibernate Removed?</h2>
<p>In the XP days, the hibernate utility sometimes did not do a good job writing that state to your hard drive.  Occasionally, your PC would not start, and could corrupt the hard drive.  Hibernate developed a lousy reliability reputation as a result.  Since hibernate and resume take a lot longer than sleep, Microsoft concluded that no one wanted to see hibernate.</p>
